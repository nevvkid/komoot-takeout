# üß≠ komoot-takeout
**Reclaim your Tours and Collections from komoot in one click with this simple desktop app.**

Building on [komootGPX](https://github.com/timschneeb/KomootGPX/), **komoot-takeout** lets you backup all your Tours including Highlights and personal photos, as well as all public **komoot Collections**.  

Consider this tool a stop-gap solution created in response to Komoot locking up our user data. It's not a replacement for the platform providing native one-click export. Be aware that Komoot may lock down their API at any time, breaking this tool. **Backup your data now.** 

## üîç Key Features

- **One-click Tour downloads**: Returns your GPX files with Highlights as points of interest and any personal photos
- **Batch download**: Download all of your Activities and Routes at once
- **Custom download folder**: Choose where to save your GPX files. 
- **Native desktop experience**: Runs as a standalone desktop application

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About This Project

This project builds on the excellent [komootGPX](https://github.com/timschneeb/KomootGPX/) library by [timschneeb](https://github.com/timschneeb), which provides the core functionality for downloading GPX tracks from Komoot. The desktop app provides a user-friendly interface for downloading your Komoot files without needing to use the command line. As it was coded in a weekend with generative AI, you may encounter errors and bugs.

- [PyWebView](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/) for the desktop window framework
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) for the web framework
- [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for HTML parsing
- [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) for executable packaging

## üöÄ Contributing
This tool contains bugs due to being rapidly coded with the help of generative AI. Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or a pull request. 

### Known issues

- Single Tour downloads (with login) result in an error. Recommended workaround: Download GPX file directly from Komoot. 
- On some Windows systems, you may see a Rectangle.op_Equality error in the logs. This is a known issue with PyWebView and doesn't affect functionality.
- If you have a firewall or antivirus, it might block the app from accessing the internet. Make sure to allow the app through your firewall.

### Log Files
The application creates a log file called `komoot_exporter.log` in the directory where you run the executable. This file contains detailed information if something goes wrong.
